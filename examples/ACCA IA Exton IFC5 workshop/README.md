This is a folder containing the files produced by ACCA software for the IA Exton IFC5 workshop.

In particular, it addresses the green cards of the Miro Board (e.g. "should be possible with existing IFCX proposal already").

Miro board available here:

Hope this helps the in-person participants with their work!
