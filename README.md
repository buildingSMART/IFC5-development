# IFC 5 Development Repository

**Welcome to the IFC 5 Alpha Examples!**  
These examples are the result of years of collaborative work by many volunteers. The IFC Implementer Forum, the IFC 5 Taskforce, and the wider community of interested implementers have been working intensively on these examples. This repository contains initial examples for the development of IFC 5.
